## Term Definitions, Basics of the Procedure, and Symptoms

Heading into my sons tonsillectomy I felt quite overwhelmed, and super uninformed on what to expect before, during, and after the procedure was performed. In my very brief appointment with the ENT **_(Ear Nose and Throat)_** Specialist, I didn't even have time to think of all of my questions. I know that for ENT Specialist, this is a super common thing to take place, maybe even a daily thing, but for me it wasn't. No one close to me had ever had a tonsillectomy performed on them or their kids, it was completely unfamiliar to me. Sooooo, I headed to the magical world of Google. Now Google can be quite overwhelming, and super over informative at times. It tends to bring things to the worst case scenario, and that can be quite scary. So as a mom that is headed into a surgical procedure with her child, that is not something I even wanted to be thinking about. I decided to share what I had learned through my research, and to share my experiences through the whole thing in hopes of educating other parents that may be looking at tonsillectomies for their kids, and are also feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and uninformed about it. I am by no means a professional, this is just some of the thing I wish I had known from the beginning.

Since I found so much information, and I wanted to be thorough in sharing everything, I decided to break it up into four main posts. We are currently on the first post._ **First Post:**
_ Term definitions
_ Basics of the procedure
_ Symptoms

- **Second Post:**
  - First visit to the ENT Specialist
  - Preparing for the procedure
- **Third Post:**
  - At the hospital
- **Fourth Post:**
  - Recovery
  - Follow up appointment, and beyond

**I feel like it would be best to first get some of the basic terms out of the way:**

\n\n\n\n

- **Tonsils:** Two small masses of lymphoid tissue in the throat, one on each side of the throat.
  - **So fun fact:** There are actually four types tonsils:
    - **Palantine Tonsils:** These are the ones seen at the back of the throat. _They are also the ones that are removed in a tonsillectomy._
    - **Adenoid Tonsils:** These are located between the back of the nose and the throat. _They are also the ones that are removed in a Adenoidectomy._
    - **Lingual Tonsils:** These are located at the base of the tongue.
    - **Tubal Tonsils:** These are located towards the top of the mouth, one on each side of the uvula.
- **Tonsillitis:** The inflamation of the tonsils.
  - So basically, tonsils are the first line of defense in fighting infection, but they do more damage than good when they become swollen. So they then need to be removed.
- **Tonsillectomy:** A surgical procedure to remove the tonsils.
  - What brought me a lot of peace in my researching was when I learned that not only is _a tonsillectomy usually an outpatient procedure, and super super common_, but it is actually _one of the oldest documented surgical procedures._ So pretty sure they have got it down, efficient, and as safe as possible. I even heard once that “back in the day” it was almost like a right of passage. Also, here is **another interesting fact: Tonsils can grow back** after being removed. It is something that is not super common to happen, and _if they do grow back they will be much smaller than the original ones._
- **Adenoidectomy:** A surgical procedure to remove the adenoids.
  - I felt it was important to bring this up because while we were at the hospital they kept throwing the term around. I was so confused. I thought we were there for a tonsillectomy, and now they were wanting to take something else out to? No... _adenoids are tonsils._ One of my sons symptoms was wheezing, and that was something caused by the adenoids being swollen. He was just having both tonsils removed. Something that is also very common.
- **ENT Specialist:** Ear, nose and throat specialist.
  - This is the doctor that performs the surgery.

**The super basics of a Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy procedure.**

\n\n\n\n

I was actually told the basics of the procedure by the anesthesiologist. He told me that, for kids, they:

\n\n\n\n

- First, get them to sleep using a gas mask
- Intubate them through their nose
- Use a tool to hold their mouth open
- Inflate a small balloon in their throat.
  - He said that this was just an extra precaution to keep the debris out.
- Next, the tonsils are removed
- The incisions are cauterized
- The last thing they do is remove the tube when the child is awake enough to breathe on their own.

**Symptoms**

\n\n\n\n

Our tonsillitis and tonsillectomy journey started with a lot of doctor visits to our pediatrician.

\n\n\n\n

Just from August to December, my son had four documented cases of **_tonsillitis_**. The _**requirements for a tonsillectomy is three in a twelve month period.**_ This wasn\'t the only symptom.

\n\n\n\n

He had**_croup every couple of months,_** no matter what the season was.

\n\n\n\n

He had**\*lots of ear infections\*\*\***,** and he had \_**really bad breath\*\*\_ – even with us brushing his teeth two times a day.

\n\n\n\n

He was also always, seriously, _**always congested,**_ and he always had a _**stuffed and runny nose.**_ He was _**constantly coughing with a sore throat.**_ And I mean constantly. Like seriously, All Of The Time! Sometimes I would think about how the poor kid would never know what it was like to not be sick.

\n\n\n\n

The worst part was that all of his _**symptoms were significantly magnified at night when he went to bed.**_ We spent countless nights either hanging out in the bathroom steamed by the shower, or, if it was cold enough, outside bundled in blankets. These were the best ways we found to give him some relief.

\n\n\n\n

I remember once he had gotten super sick and was sleeping in my room, and I had noticed he was _**snoring**_. I mean like really snoring, like an old man would. I remember thinking it was so weird. Now, in hindsight, I know that it was just another symptom.

\n\n\n\n

Here are some of the things I have found that assist in relieving his symptoms:

\n\n\n\n

- Zarbees
- Highlands Cough and Cold
- Allegra or Claritin
- We made sure to give it to him once in the morning and once at night consistently
- We always ran a humidifier at night
- Even if his symptoms didn\'t seen bad
- Cold air always made his cough feel better
- Cough drop suckers

\n\n\n\n

That\'s all for this section. Don\'t forget to check out my next section, where I will cover:
